# DynText
A customizable text-widget for your top bar.

## What makes it special?
- There is **no GUI**.
    - The text can be modified through your terminal or a text editor of your choice.
- Display anything you can write in **one line** of a file on your top bar
    - The only size limitation is the length of your top bar.
- Display anything larger than one line in a **popup-menu**
    - Anything written after the first line will be put in a popup menu, activated by pressing the widget.
- Periodic **updates**
    - Every 30 seconds the DynText widget will check your text-source again and update itself.
    > The duration between each update will be customizable in the futureâ„¢.
